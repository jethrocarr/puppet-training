# Puppet Training

This module provides a stack for launching Puppet training environments for
teaching people about Puppet module development.

It provides a stack that can be launched per-user to give them a Puppet master
and a Puppet client for learning the Puppet DSL, the r10k workflow and other
good Puppet skills.

We specifically consider the setup of a Puppet master/server and PuppetDB
out-of-scope, this topic is better covered by the Puppetlabs documentation as
the configuration can be complex and varies a lot per environment.


# Features

* Fully automatic provisioning.
* Support for AWS via CloudFormation.
* Ubuntu 16.04 with Puppet 4.
* Creates Puppet master plus node for testing Puppet modules on.
* Sets up r10k workflow.
* Provides various learning exercises


# Expected Knowledge

Staff under taking this training must be:

1. Reasonably comfortable with a command line Linux environment.

2. Understand how to use tools like Git and text editors.


# Training Materials

All the training materials are located inside the `modules` directory. The
various modules are numbered sequentially and should be followed in that order.

Before starting the modules, make sure you have provisioned a stack per-user
and validated correct operation of the environment.


# Can I use this for provisioning a real production environment?

No. In order to meet the requirements of a simple, easy to setup and use
training environment we've made certain design decisions that would be stupid
in a real world environment. Use this project for what is is, a chance to learn
Puppet's DSL and how a master-full Puppet environment behaves like, but once
done move on and build some proper infrastructure.


# Stack Provisioning

For all users:

1. Setup an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account if you have not already.

2. Provision a VPC. This can be a NAT-based VPC, where the instances will remain
   hidden from the public internet, or you can use a VPC with IGW as long as the
   subnet you provide is set to auto-assign public IP space. Note that this will
   expose the training VMs to the public web, which means port `22` and port
   `80` could be reached by untrustworthy parties.


For each member taking part in training:

1. Create a Key Pair for each user taking part in the training.

2. Launch the environment using the `stack.yaml` file. For example:
    ```
    aws --profile sandbox \
    cloudformation \
    create-stack \
    --stack-name "puppet-training-bob" \
    --template-body file://resources/stack.yaml \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameters \
    ParameterKey=KeyName,ParameterValue=MyKey \
    ParameterKey=VpcId,ParameterValue=vpc-xyz123 \
    ParameterKey=SubnetId,ParameterValue=subnet-xyz
    ```
    The stack launches the servers used for training and pulls down user data
    located inside this repo to provision the servers.
